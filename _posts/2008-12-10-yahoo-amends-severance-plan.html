<p>Interesting <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/e/081210/yhoo8-k.html">change of terms of the YHOO severance package</a> to "sweeten" a potential deal, and avoid a multi-billion bill for a Change of Control. I suspect the Board of Directors might be preparing for a change and a take-over. YHOO was up 9.93% today (although this filing was made public after the market closed).</p>
