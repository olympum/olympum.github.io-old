<p>The Java EE 5 architecture, with its use of annotations brings the Java world <span style="font-style: italic">close</span> to being agile. The architecture is absolutely fantastic and powerful, with superb messaging (JMS), persistence (EJB3), transactions (JTA), and integration (JCA) capabilities.</p>
<p>However, on the presentation side, for the web world, Java is still behind both .NET and agile frameworks like Rails or Django. JSF is cumbersome, and still too attached to the systems-programming intensive request-response Model2 that ended up in JSPs and Struts. Wicket and Tapestry are possibly the top component-based development web frameworks for Java. But they are both only used by a relatively small community, and documentation, mostly in the case of Wicket, is deficient, especially when it comes to topics such as integration with persistence frameworks.</p>
<p>In terms of setting a complete development environment, it is painful. Setting up Netbeans/Eclipse, JBoss/Geronimo/Glassfish, Wicket, and EJB3 to play nicely with each other is not easy, and it has lots of rough edges. It takes too long to setup an environment and start coding.</p>
<p>That myriad of frameworks and standards is what makes Java EE so powerful, yet so cumbersome. I was hoping annotations could have solved most of the integration complexity, but I am disappointed. So, sadly, my hopes for a "new Java" are yet once again down. Java EE still gets on your way to being productive.</p>
<p>I am back to Rails for the time being, at least until Java EE 5 matures.</p>
