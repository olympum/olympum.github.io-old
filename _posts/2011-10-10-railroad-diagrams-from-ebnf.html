<p>I am playing with a new query language. I am defining the grammar as EBNF, but<br />
I want to show railroad diagrams for those readers that are more graphical and<br />
less familiar with BNF. I've found limited support for generating syntax<br />
diagrams from EBNF. I've found a few tools, some working better than others:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/ebnf2ps/">Ebnf2ps</a><br />
(Haskell). This is the only tool I have not been able to get to work. I seem<br />
to be missing AFM fonts in my TeX installation and I am not sure I want to<br />
spend time figuring out how to generate the AFM files.</li>
<li>SQLite <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/doc/tip/art/syntax/bubble-generator.tcl?mimetype=text/plain">bubble generator</a><br />
(Tk/Tcl). Strictly this tool does not consume EBNF grammars, but a custom<br />
DSL. If I didn't care about EBNF, this would be the best tool</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/featurist/node-ebnf-diagram">node-ebnf-diagram</a><br />
(Javascript). Although it works, I have to issues with it. One is that it<br />
can only generate PNG files. That would not be too bad if it weren't for the<br />
second issue: the tool does not automatically resize the canvas, and it<br />
requires explicit width and height input. If I don't find anything else,<br />
I'll probably end up using it.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EbnfToPsPackage">ebnf2ps.el</a> (Emacs Lisp).<br />
It works as advertised. The only issue I found is that the diagrams<br />
generated have a small white gap on the lines on the right hand side.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.antlr.org/download.html">ANTLRWorks</a> (Java). Bundled with antlr,<br />
it fits the task. Once you are in the game of defining the grammar in Java,<br />
why not just go ahead and use the same tool to generate not only the parser<br />
but the diagrams? This is what the tool does. Even if you are not doing a<br />
Java parser/lexer, this is a good tool to use for documentation purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am using ANTLRWorks, generating all the diagrams from the command line as part of my markdown transform pipeline:</p>
<pre><code>java -cp antlrworks-1.1.4.jar org.antlr.works.Console -f yql.g -o output/ -sd eps
</code></pre>
<p>It works very well.</p>
