Eweek reports about <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2092971,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03119TX1K0000594">Microsoft's architecture guidance on SaaS</a> (Software as a Service).  There is <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/architecture/bb229292.aspx">code, a video and a screencast released on MSDN</a> which I highly recommend watching. Well done, Microsoft.
