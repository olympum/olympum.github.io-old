<p>The release of Facebook's Open Graph Protocol has spurred renewed interest<br />
in the semantic web. I give credit to Facebook for pushing forward an RDFa<br />
derived format onto the world wide web. In fact, RDFa is the least<br />
interesting part. Producing semantic data has been around for a long time.<br />
Most importantly, I give Facebook credit for focusing on the interesting<br />
part of the problem: consumption of semantic data.</p>
<p>And although it's a great achievement, I regret the locked-in and<br />
centralized nature of Facebook's Open Graph Protocol. The web is an open<br />
environment, where open wins at the end.</p>
<h2>Entity Identifiers</h2>
<p>Facebook assigns and owns internal identifiers to entities. These<br />
identifiers do not look unique, nor something that external parties,<br />
disconnected from Facebook could assign, inspect or do anything useful with.<br />
By owning the identifiers, Facebook is owning the entity graph.</p>
<p>The assumption of a single party owning the identifiers for entities is<br />
fundamentally flawed. Entities appear, disappear, merge and fork. Known<br />
entities change constantly, and most importantly what you and I, or anybody<br />
else understands and knows as an entity is different. IMDB and Netflix will<br />
both describe the movie "The Book of Eli", however each use different<br />
identifiers. To assume that one unique identifier can be used consistently<br />
and universally across the web leads to information lock-in.</p>
<p>Luckily, the web is an open environment. And, at the end, open wins on the<br />
web (prove by induction to the avid reader).</p>
<p>Identity on the open web is federated, starting at the top-level domain<br />
identifiers, and all the web to a fully qualified Universal Resource<br />
Identifiers (URIs). In reality, there are many sources of truth. Some of<br />
those are canonical, or trusted, yet many other sources exist. Movies data<br />
from IMDB or Netflix will usually be considered canonical. Yet that does not<br />
stop Wikipedia, or any web publisher, from creating its own entities. All it<br />
takes is a URI.</p>
<p>Anybody on the web, be it Facebook or Freebase, can make statements such as:<br />
this URI on Netflix is about the same movie as this other URI on IMDB. All<br />
it takes is a web page with a couple of links. The difference between<br />
Facebook and the "web" way, is that a web page is identified by a URI, and<br />
anybody can create one in a federated way. Not just Facebook.</p>
<h2>Semantic Web Annotation Techniques</h2>
<p>The most interesting value of the web is not about describing resources, or<br />
the roles of the relationships between resources, but the relationships<br />
themselves. The statement "Madonna is related to Guy Ritchie" is, in<br />
relative terms, more important than the more fact-complete "Madonna is Guy<br />
Ritchie's ex-wife". Although the fact "ex-wife" increases knowledge, it has<br />
only value once we asserted that the relationship exists. Establishing<br />
relationships can be achieved through links and URIs. That's what the web is<br />
about. Pages and links to other pages.</p>
<p>The problem however with the current web of pages and links is that all URIs<br />
are anonymous. Ideally, I would like to bring some structure to those<br />
relationships so that I can codify exactly what "ex-wife" means. That's what<br />
semantic annotations address: naming the role in the relationship between<br />
resources in a structured format.</p>
<p>Inlined semantic annotations, ala Facebook, is one possible way of linking<br />
data sets. The issue however with this approach is that the meta-data about<br />
the resource is mingled with the data. This creates a number of problems.<br />
First, there is an arbitrary distinction between what constitutes data and<br />
what is metadata. Additionally, one needs to be able to parse the resource<br />
format in order to find the semantic annotations. Aside the parsing<br />
computing cost, adding semantic annotations to videos, images, etc. would<br />
require custom extensions to be container format, which is practically<br />
unfeasible. Practically speaking inline semantic annotations are only<br />
partially useful, and only for text-readable content types.</p>
<p>A better alternative would be to use out-of-line semantic annotations. In<br />
this model, we cleanly separate meta-data from the resource data itself.<br />
This separation should be not just syntactical, but structural. Semantic<br />
annotation constructs should treat the data as an opaque resource. For all<br />
we care, we should treat all data as binary resources. If we wanted to look<br />
into the data, an specialized parser would read the data, and surface<br />
interesting facts that we could then promote to metadata.</p>
<p>The first possible construct that provides out-of-line semantic annotations<br />
is the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-10">Link HTTP<br />
Header</a>.<br />
Using link headers we can describe a web resource without having to parse<br />
the payload, by simply looking at the HTTP headers. Examples of usage for<br />
link headers could include:</p>
<pre><code>  Link: &lt;http://www.cern.ch/TheBook/chapter2&gt;; rel="Previous"
  Link: &lt;mailto:timbl@w3.org&gt;; rev="Made"; title="Tim Berners-Lee"
</code></pre>
<p>Although powerful, link headers are not particularly accessible for most<br />
publishers, since they require programming access to the web server to<br />
generate those link headers. Additionally, if we are only interested in the<br />
semantic annotations, fetching a full document only to throw it away is<br />
highly inefficient both for consumer and publisher.</p>
<p>A better construct to provide out-of-line semantic annotations is to create<br />
a separate resource altogether representing the semantic annotations for the<br />
parent resource. This alternative, alike link headers, also differentiates<br />
between data and meta-data, but does not require stack changes to HTTP.<br />
Furthermore, it does not require the publisher to generate those semantic<br />
annotations. Anybody can publish semantic annotation documents for any<br />
resource on the web. In that sense, the use of out-of-line semantic<br />
documents that describe web resources is truly open and federated.</p>
<h2>The Linked-Atom</h2>
<p>There are many possible formats for describing resources in an out-of-line<br />
fashions. One of the most interesting formats ones is the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">The Atom<br />
Publishing Format</a>. With Atom, the<br />
focus is on identity and linking resources. The actual content is hidden<br />
away.</p>
<p>But within the context of semantic annotations, Atom has its<br />
<a href="http://www.olympum.com/future/a-web-linked-by-atoms/">shortcomings</a>. Rather<br />
than abusing Atom, perhaps we need to create a separate, specialized<br />
out-of-line resource descriptor. I call such format the "Linked-Atom". There<br />
are a few differences between Atoms and Linked-Atoms. Whereas the atom is a<br />
generic format for content publishing, the linked-atom is only using for<br />
linking web resources.</p>
<p>Let's consider a graph whereby:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each resource on the web is unique identified by a URI. Let's make such<br />
resource a vertex, and the identity of this vertex be the URI.</li>
<li>A resource can link to other resources, also identified by URIs. We'll<br />
make each link a directed edge, and the link's identity the URI of the<br />
target resource.</li>
<li>Edges have a type, which corresponds to the type of the target resource.</li>
<li>Edges might be named, or remain anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this graph, the set of a vertex and its outbound edges constitutes a<br />
linked-atom. The linked-atom introduces some additional constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linked-atom is immutable. A change in the graph (adding or removing<br />
edges, or changing edge types or edge names) creates a new Atom, with the<br />
vertex identifier and a new revision number.</li>
<li>Linked-atoms are identified by a composite key composed of the vertex<br />
identifier and the revision identifier.</li>
<li>The list of all linked-atoms describing all revisions of a vertex<br />
constitutes a collection.</li>
<li>Collections are uniquely identified by the vertex identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>A possible JSON representation for a linked-atom would be:</p>
<pre><code>    {
        "id": "http://example.com/foo.html",
        "rev_id": 1,
        "links": [
            {
                "id": "http://example.com/bar.html",
                "rev_id": 2,
                "type": "text/html",
                "name": "bar" 
            },
            {
                "id": "http://example.com/toto.png",
                "rev_id": 1,
                "type": "image/png",
                "name": "toto" 
            }
        ] 
    }
</code></pre>
<p>A more compact representation of the atom is perhaps more interesting for<br />
extracting information. Instead of grouping all the edges into a single<br />
document, we would create describe each vertex-edge relationship as a<br />
N-tuple. A possible implementation of the linked-atom could use n-tuples to<br />
store the data:</p>
<pre><code>    http://example.com/foo.html 1 http://example.com/bar.html 2 text/html bar
    http://example.com/foo.html 1 http://example.com/toto.png 1 image/png toto
</code></pre>
<h2>The Graph</h2>
<p>Using linked-atoms, we can model the information in the web, not simply as a<br />
graph of pages and links, but a graph of named and typed links between<br />
vertices. Each linked-atom represents a statement about a web resource, a<br />
piece of knowledge. The advantage of a linked-atom graph is that anybody can<br />
publish a document making statements via linked-atoms and collections of<br />
linked-atoms, and not just the publisher of the web resource.</p>
<p>This is in contrast with Facebook's Open Graph Protocol, where only the<br />
publisher of the web resource can make such statements, and where only one<br />
consumer assigns identifiers to those statements. Maybe the Linked-Atom is<br />
not the perfect construct, but it provides an alternative to what I see as a<br />
centralized lock-in model that threatens the open nature of the web.</p>
