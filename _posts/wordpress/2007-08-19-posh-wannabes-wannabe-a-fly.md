This 70s sunglasses retro-look inspired by our very own Victoria
Beckham, "posh", and America's greatest exhibitionist Paris Hilton, is
starting to become annoying. Strikingly similar to a fly's eyes,
generally esthetically unpleasant sunglasses are taking over London
this summer. People covering their eyes with black lenses of the size
of satellite dishes. Men and women, alike, being fashionable human
flies.

<p>I had never seen flies in the London underground, until now. A pest of human flies with big dark black eyes has taken over. Strange looking aliens from the X-Files are invading the tube.</p>
<p>I wonder if the devil still wears Prada.</p>
