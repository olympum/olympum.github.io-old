Yes, you are right, not Malkovich, but Phileas Fogg. At exactly
10.30am sharp today, I popped into a taxi that took me to Heathrow
Terminal 4. I am currently writing from the BA Business Lounge waiting
for my plane and ahead of my tour "Around the World in 15 days". And
yes, I am beating Mr. Fogg by an impressive 65 days (although a good
137 years later to tell the truth)!

<p>I am flying east, same direction as Phileas Fogg, with stops in
Bangalore, Singapore, Seoul, Sunyvale, Toronto and back to London
Heathrow. Obviously I am not Jules Verne, but I'll be blogging each
day about my trip.</p> <p>I had a good start. Check in at Heathrow was
nice and smooth, except the stupidity that I have to put my laptop bag
into my carry-on luggage while going through security, only to take it
out right after clearning security. I guess the queues if passengers
were not limited to 1 bag would be even longer, but given that there
are no queues in business class, why do the authorities keep enforcing
this rule? I really fail to see it as a security measure, it's just a
workload problem.</p>
