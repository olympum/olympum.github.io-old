<p>I keep saying that the web follows the pattern of the fashion industry. It's about image, it's about fun, it's about entertaining.  Sure, you can also buy stuff and do useful things. But that's what you <em>have</em> to do, not what you <em>want</em> to do.</p>
<p>That's why  facebook is popular - it's fun, it's about image, it's about entertainment.</p>
<p>And now, to prove it,  a nice chart <a href="http://flowingdata.com/2008/05/01/chart-of-the-day-a-breakdown-of-facebook-applications/" title="Facebook applications">for the breakout of Facebook applications</a>.</p>
