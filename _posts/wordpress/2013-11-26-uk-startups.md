Since I moved to London, now over half a year ago, I have been talking
to entrepreneurs and investors about London, and not just London folks
but also investors in Israel, the East Coast and Silicon Valley. I
have also met with many companies across Europe in the context of
corporate development at Yahoo. Although London has many of the
ingredients required for becoming the next startup hub, it also has
many structural problems that will prevent it from growing as fast as
other centers, such as Tel Aviv. I moved to London excited about
creating a strong product development centre for Yahoo, in one of the
hottest startup cities in the world. I am still hopeful we can still
shape London to become such hub. But it requires a significant and non
trivial amount of work from the UK government. This is a critical
issue for the future of any economic power in the world that wants to
be a global leader in the 21st century.

First, technology is eating the world and software specifically is
creating a revolution of how we understand the agricultural,
industrial and services sectors. Software has the ability to disrupt
existing business models, and rather often also to create new ones,
much faster than ever before. The type of innovation possible with
only software is unprecented and the speed at which a new disruptive
business model can be scaled today compared to 15 years ago is at
least one order of magnitude bigger. In fact, the boundary of
innovation is now becoming the availability (and scarcity) of data and
scientific modeling to structure data, and not necessarily software
itself. Large amounts of data and powerful software computing
platforms, a combination popularly coined under the term "big data",
is allowing humans to change the face of the earth as we know it
today.

Second, startup companies are the engine of the economy. They create
true, i.e. non-speculative or financially engineered, new wealth and
drive the GDP growth for countries in the mid to long term. Any
economy that wants to grow fast globally now needs to consider how to
enable a powerful world of innovation with startups as the root
ingredient. Innovation from large multi-nationals is still very
helpful, since the scale of these companies amplifies the impact of
new ideas when put into the right environment. But in general most
large companies fail to cannibalize themselves in order to create "the
next big thing", and only startups are na√Øve enough to dare and
perhaps even sometimes crazy enough to try.

The UK government is asking how they can help get onto this engine of
growth for the 21st century. We hear surprise and see puzzling faces
when I mention that London is not working out, followed by questions
as of how London could become the next Silicon Valley. The best UK
engineers and entrepreneurs leave to go to the Bay Area. Honestly,
nothing else matters, tax, funding, etc. Whilst such talent exodus
continues to happen, the ecosystem will never work. I hear reports of
great successes in London, but little is spoken of the larger
structural challenges we face. I am not arguing that I have all the
answers, not even part of the answers. But it's clear that we are at a
point where there are still more questions than answers, and we need
to start the social debate from entrepreneurs, investors and citizines
formulating those questions, around talent, funding, market, exit, ...

Specifically, to spark the debate, these are macro issues that I am
seeing:

* Small funds, small bets, none really significant enough and driving
  the cost of capital to be higher, especially during early stages.
* Investors reward average returns and lack the risk profile for early
  startups. Therefore there are no big runs.
* Entrepreneurs, if they are good, they are no longer in UK. If they
  succeed, they build lifestyle businesses. Again, no big runs and VCs
  are in fact happy that their money is not lost.
* Talent is not just raw talent. Not even academia. Large corporate
  technology companies are training grounds for the next gen of
  startups. But London does not attract the right target companies
  with the best tax incentives available in the world. Socially,
  giving such advantage to large foreign corporations is not accepted.
