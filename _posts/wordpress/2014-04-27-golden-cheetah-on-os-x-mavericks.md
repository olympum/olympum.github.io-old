I am a big fan of collecting and tracking the data from all the sensor device gadgets I use in my workout. For indoor cycling, I recently bought an Elite Qubo Power Fluid trainer, so I wanted to get the power curve into the software I am using for tracking cycling, Golden Cheetah.

## First Build ##

Using homebrew we install Qt4. I did not try with Qt5 which is not as widely used anyway as Qt4.

{% highlight bash %}
brew install qt4
{% endhighlight %}

Then checkout the Golden Cheetah code out of github:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah.git
{% endhighlight %}

We then create the qmake config files that will generate the GNU Makefile:

{% highlight bash %}
cd GoldenCheetah
cp qwt/qwtconfig.pri.in qwt/qwtconfig.pri
cp src/gcconfig.pri.in src/gcconfig.pri
{% endhighlight %}

We edit `src/gcconfig.pri` to uncomment the OSX options:

{% highlight Makefile %}
# Uncomment this line if you have SDK 10.7 or higher
DEFINES += GC_HAVE_LION
# uncomment below if you are running on the 10.9 developer preview
INCLUDEPATH += /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/usr/include/ 
{% endhighlight %}

To enable the USB2 ANT+ dongle support (`libusb-compat` provides a `0.1` version wrapper interface using the `libusb 1.0` implementation):

{% highlight bash %}
brew install libusb-compat
{% endhighlight %}

And change `src/gcconfig.pri` to enable USB:

{% highlight Makefile %}
LIBUSB_INSTALL = /usr/local
#LIBUSB_INCLUDE = 
LIBUSB_LIBS    = -lusb
{% endhighlight %}

Note the `LIBUSB_LIBS` directive to point to libusb.a, which if we
installed libusb with Homebrew, it is a symbolic link to the compat
version 0.1.4. If we leave the directive empty, which is the default
the config make system will pick up libusb-1.0.a, which will be
missing symbols during final linking with the GoldenCheetah app.

I tried to make at this point but it failed saying it could not find
the .qm files. Looking on the web these seem to be generated
translation files. So I did init these translation files, although I
am not sure why this is required and not caught by the Makefile. In
any case:

{% highlight bash%}
lrelease src/src.pro
{% endhighlight %}

And build:

{% highlight bash%}
qmake -recursive
make
{% endhighlight %}

The app once built is found under `src/GoldenCheetah.app`.

## Quick Note on Other Dependencies ##

* SRMIO. Serial communication protocol to the SRM bike power meter. I
don't need it.
* Liboauth. To post to twitter. I don't think need it.
* libkml. Export to Google Earth. I don't think I need it.
* QwtPlot3d. Hmm ... not sure what this is for, yet.
* libical. Don't know, I skip.
* clucene. Don't know yet if I need it, so I skip.

## Elite Qubo Power Fluid as a Virtual Powertap ##

[PowerCurveSensor.com](http://www.powercurvesensor.com/files/45c.png) provides a power curve for this trainer unit. The manufacturer also provides a curve, but I did not find it to be as accurate. I fit the speed-to-power curve using a cubic equation. The resulting equation is:

		f(x) = 4.31746 * x + -2.59259e-002 * x^2 +  9.41799e-003 * x^3

where x is expressed in km/h and f(x) is measured Watts. We add the switch case in `RealtimeController.cpp`:

{% highlight C++ %}
case 42:
{
double V = rtData.getSpeed();
// Power curve fit from powercurvesensor
rtData.setWatts(4.31746 * V - 2.59259e-002 * pow(V, 2) + 9.41799e-003 * pow(V, 3));
}
break;
{% endhighlight %}	

We also need to change the UI code in `AddDeviceWizard.cpp`:

{% highlight C++ %}
virtualPower->addItem(tr("Power - Elite Supercrono Powermag (8)"));
virtualPower->addItem(tr("Power - Elite Qubo Power Fluid"));

wheelSize->addItem(tr("Road/Cross (700C/622)")); // 2100mm
wheelSize->addItem(tr("Tri/TT (650C)")); // 1960mm

{% endhighlight %}

Recompile by invoking <code>make</code> and open the app. Add a new speed and cadence ANT+ sensor device, and voil√°, the Qubo Fluid shows up in GoldenCheetah as a virtual powertap.
