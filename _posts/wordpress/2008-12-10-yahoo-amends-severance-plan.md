Interesting <a
href="http://biz.yahoo.com/e/081210/yhoo8-k.html">change of terms of
the YHOO severance package</a>Â to "sweeten" a potential deal, and
avoid a multi-billion bill for a Change of Control. I suspect the
Board of Directors might be preparing for a change and a take-over.
YHOO was up 9.93% today (although this filing was made public after
the market closed).
