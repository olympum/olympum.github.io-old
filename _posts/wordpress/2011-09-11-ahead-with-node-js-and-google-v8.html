<p>It has been 10 months since I posted about Google V8. But somebody re-started<br />
<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2982684">a thread again on Hacker News</a><br />
about <a href="http://www.olympum.com/future/answering-jason-on-v8-governance-and-impact-to-nodejs/">my old blog<br />
post</a>.<br />
So now I am compelled to briefly say where we are at.</p>
<p>We have continued and extended our investment in Node.JS. I can tell you that<br />
what the teams are doing is transformative and pure awesomeness. Unfortunately<br />
this is as much as I can tell you right now, but really soon you'll start<br />
hearing what we've done. In every single demo, internal and external, we have<br />
done of the technology, the feedback has been fantastic. I am very happy and<br />
fortunate to have a team of super-stars working on this.</p>
<p>As per my concern on being locked into Google V8 and not being able to support<br />
the software, things have changed since I last blogged. First, Google has been<br />
very, very, supportive addressing V8 bugs whenever they existed.</p>
<p>Secondly, here at Yahoo! we donated some code to the fine folks at Mozilla to<br />
<a href="https://github.com/bfrancojr/v8monkey">wrap the Spidermonkey API with the V8<br />
API</a>. Mozilla went on to create a full<br />
implementation of <a href="http://blog.zpao.com/post/4620873765/about-that-hybrid-v8monkey-engine">Node.JS on<br />
Spidermonkay</a><br />
and provide the architectural re-assurance we needed. I am still surprised<br />
however from the discussion on the blogosphere and twitterspace months ago<br />
about how many developers don't seem to pay attention to open source<br />
governance. When you have the responsibility for a multi-million dollar<br />
technology investment, you want to make sure you cover all your bases.</p>
<p>Finally, we have partnered closely with the fine folks at Joyent and are<br />
working through the final stages of negotiation for how we'll work together<br />
going forward.</p>
<p>Let me say that I am really excited about what the technology innovation that<br />
Node.JS is bringing to the industry, whether that is to create a new<br />
generation of I/O intensive servers, or to bring Javascript to the<br />
server-side. I see Node.JS' future is bright.</p>
