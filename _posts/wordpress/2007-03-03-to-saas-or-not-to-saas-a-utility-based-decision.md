I remain skeptic about any attempts to break out SaaS value/price in a pure TCO, like in <a href="http://www.techweb.com/article/showArticle.jhtml?articleId=197007820">this article by Barry Rosenberg and Craig Wright on techweb</a>. If nothing else, simply because of the (human) random nature of choosing between intangibles such as security, mobility, usability, ... which are all <em>perceptions</em>.

<p>Whereas I agree with the authors that the key challenge in comparing licensed to hosted software is establishing a common measuring tape to avoid comparing apples and pears, I don't agree that it's possible to quantify such measuring tape as a TCO model, simply because of the random nature of perception.</p>
<p>The choice process in deciding between licensed software and SaaS is not very different from the one we go through to choose between a Mac and a PC, between buying a house and a flat, between choosing to drive to work or taking a train, etc. The decision maker is forced in these cases to make a choice based on things that are simply not rationally comparable. In the case of SaaS, we must compare licensing costs to convenience of upgrades; in-house security-tight infrastructure to SLAs and trust models on hosted services; ubiquitous presence to speed of use; and a long list of other incomparable properties. While it is true that each decision maker, each CIO, will have different a measuring tape, no CIO will be able to put down the choice of SaaS vs licensed software as a TCO decision.</p>
<p>The choice of software hosting model (in-house vs off-house/SaaS) is a random utility-based decision, which can be modeled using <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/mcfadden/index.shtml">random utility models</a> (RUM). RUMs are not only necessary for SaaS vendors to be able to adequately price their services, they are also a good modeling technique for decision makers to be able to compare between otherwise incomparable choices.</p>
