<p>Today's <a href="http://www.technewsworld.com/rsstory/55657.html">TechnNews article about Nokia's smart2go</a> brings up an interesting business model competing with GPS navigation devices such as Tom-Tom. <a href="http://www.smart2go.com/en/">Nokia's German-based Gate5  smart2go</a> is a free map service based on Symbian EPOC for Series 60, although probably we will see across other Nokia phones. smart2go offers free maps, which can be downloaded from a PC (I guess for planned usual routes) or over the air and bluetooth (for unplanned routes -- oops, I am lost!) One can store map files to the phone's MMC (obviously to its storage limit).</p>
<p>Whereas traditionally GPS navigation devices have charged upfront for the hardware device, and provided free mapping and navigation service, smart2go has no starting costs (if you already have a compatible device), and maps and local guides are free. Navigation services however are not free - smart2go offers daily, monthly or yearly subscriptions. I believe it is this flexibility in the subscription model what will make it interesting for a number of people that do not need to use a Tom-Tom every day.</p>
