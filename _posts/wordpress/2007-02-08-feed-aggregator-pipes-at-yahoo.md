I had a quick go at <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo!'s new pipes product</a>. Yahoo! pipes is an aggregator product (not intended for end-consumers) to visually program/constract feed aggregators from any sources. It looks complex as a consumer concept, and it is, but it's actually really easy to use as a programming tool. It took me less than 5 minutes to create a <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/tntDHnO32xG98CgCr_ymrA/">feed aggregator for stock news</a>.

<p>It would be really interesting now if the aggregated feed results ("pipe output") could be mashed up into other sources, like Yahoo! Maps, etc. using GeoRSS, KML or alike. That would then become a true consumer product!</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>It seems like <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9010938&amp;source=rss_news10">Yahoo! pipes got clogged</a>. The site was brought down a few hours ago due to excessive demand. It received more attention that originally envisaged! Well, that's a good thing. I hope it comes back soon.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The service is back up.</p>
