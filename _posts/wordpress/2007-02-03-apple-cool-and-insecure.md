Apple has made significant (relative) intakes into the OS business. I mean, wow, Apple is cool. I like the Aqua looks, the whole iPod culture (which to be true is the one making Apple popular -- I even bought a pink mini for my daughter Ana√Øs). But a mouse with one button? Hell ... if a command line guy like me is really desperate to get a mouse, he certainly won't be getting a mouse without a middle button, not to talk about a mouse with a single button! I still think the single coolest feature in X11 for donkey years has been the middle button. Anyway, I am digressing.

So, yeah, cool and everything, the scripting kiddies loving their Macs, big marketing and communications machine, but Apple has failed to think beyond Vista and NeXT, and not only that, <a href="http://applefun.blogspot.com/2007/01/moab-31-01-2007-stay-tuned-and-farewell.html" title="Mac-Bug-A-Day">it has messed up the whole BSD kernel rendering every single Mac OS out there as insecure as Windows OS</a>. Well done boys.
