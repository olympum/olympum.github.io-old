Yahoo!'s new search platform, project Panama, is already showing a win over the last month. A study by <a href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=1222">comScore</a> shows significant increases in Yahoo's click through rates, and ad effectiveness when compared to normal links. But to me what is more important, is that Yahoo! is showing due transparency to publishers. Google's lack of visibility is an abuse to 99% of publishers who have absolutely no idea of what goes on with click-through revenue sharing. And Google it's not only a black box: it's an abuse (don't be evil!??). Yahoo! is certainly hitting Google right where it hurts with YPN.
