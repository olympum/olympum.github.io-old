<p><strong>Update:</strong> Jason Hoffman (Chief Scientist, Founder of Joyent) has written a <a href="http://joyeur.com/2011/02/05/on-brunos-concern-about-the-current-coupling-of-node-js-and-v8/">very good response</a> to this post. Obviously I owe him some responses, which is <a href="http://www.olympum.com/future/answering-jason-on-v8-governance-and-impact-to-nodejs/">on a separate post</a>.</p>
<p>If you have not watched <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/08/30/yui-theater-douglas-crockford-crockford-on-javascript-scene-6-loopage-52-min/">Douglas Crockford's video lecture on server-side<br />
Javascript</a>,<br />
I recommend you do that first before reading further into this post.</p>
<p>I have been saying for a while that <a href="http://www.olympum.com/internet/why-node-js-matters/">server-side Javascript<br />
matters</a>. We, at Yahoo!,<br />
see <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/11/on-deck-yuiconf-2010-with-a-focus-on-yui-yql-and-node-js/">a bright future in server-side<br />
Javascript</a><br />
and are making a big investment in it. But if you <a href="http://twitter.com/olympum">follow me on<br />
twitter</a>, you'll know that I am also looking into<br />
ensuring high-availability of server-side Javascript-based services on<br />
production. Which really comes down to something like: to V8 or not to V8.</p>
<p>NodeJS is currently tightly coupled to Google's V8 engine. V8 was not designed<br />
as a server-side engine, but as a browser-based engine. Furthermore, V8 was<br />
designed squarely to run in Chrome's multi-process model. As much as I think<br />
V8 is a brilliant piece of engineering, it's software that was not designed to<br />
run on a server.</p>
<p>More to the point, it's really up to Google to work with the community to make<br />
V8 work on the server-side. Sometimes Google is responsive, but sometimes it<br />
might not. It varies as it depends how fixing a bug or applying a patch may<br />
align with Google's product roadmap and plans. I don't know Google's plans, and I<br />
suspect most NodeJS committers don't know either.</p>
<p>Maybe for some folks this might not seem like a big problem. And probably, if<br />
you are running a site with a few thousand daily page views, it might actually<br />
not be a big deal. But to Yahoo!, and <a href="http://amix.dk/blog/post/19577">to<br />
others</a>, it's a big deal and we believe this<br />
is fundamental to the success of the NodeJS project.</p>
<p>Writing a Javascript runtime that does not fail is hard. Even the really smart<br />
V8 folks have explicitly designed V8 for failures to happen and safeguard the<br />
browser. In a browser, a JS engine failure is an inconvenience to the user:<br />
damn, you lost a tab. In a thread-per-request blocking I/O server design it's<br />
also not a big deal, you lose one in-flight request. But in an event-driven<br />
web server, it's a major flaw, you lose thousands of in-flight requests you<br />
have already accepted.</p>
<p>For NodeJS to scale to billions of page views like Yahoo!'s, we need to<br />
make sure the Javascript engine / VM behind Node is rock-solid for server-side<br />
loads, i.e. it fails extremely rarely.</p>
<p>Google may invest on supporting V8 on the server-side, just like the Mozilla<br />
folks do. Or somebody else might invest and ensure V8 is rock-solid on the<br />
server and Google may merge the patches nicely. Or maybe not, and the<br />
community may need to fork V8. Or something else ... Nobody really knows.</p>
<p>Either way, it's time for the NodeJS community to realise there is a<br />
roadblock and discuss it openly.</p>
