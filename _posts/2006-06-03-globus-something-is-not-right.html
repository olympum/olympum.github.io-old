<p>I was reading yesterday the tutorial for the Globus Toolkit 4 (<a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/">GT4</a>), especifically <a href="http://gdp.globus.org/gt4-tutorial/multiplehtml/ch03s01.html">this</a> and <a href="http://gdp.globus.org/gt4-tutorial/multiplehtml/ch03s02.html">this</a> page. It highly disturbs me. Something is not right. It reminds me of the CORBA, and early day's of EJBs. 90% systems programming, for 10% application programming. Thankfully AOP, Spring, Hibernate and friends kicked in to help, and introduced Inversion of Control to the masses. Hollywood's principle for everybody.</p>
<p>In GT4, you code manually the WSDL, and your Java classes reference directly the framework and XSD namespaces.</p>
<p>I believe writing the WSDL/XSD by hand is a good thing when you are writing truely reusable (web) services, to ensure they are not just doing RPC over a pretty crappy protocol, and you are focusing on the message. However, if Globus is to be used for parallel computing, ala my beloved <a href="http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/">PVM</a>, you actually want RPC-style, and Globus should be generating the WSDL automatically upon deployment without developer's intervention.</p>
<p>Additionally, when it comes to the Java side, the code looks like an EJB in the 90s. I don't care if you could generate that code, it simply sucks as a class.</p>
<p>I look forward to the Spring of GT4 to come out really soon!</p>
