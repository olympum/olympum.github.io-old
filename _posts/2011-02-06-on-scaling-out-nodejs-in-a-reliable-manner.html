<h2>Single-Thread I/O</h2>
<p>Why this is good, separating I/O from CPU. Exception with large shared state,<br />
i.e. YCS. Reliability and stress tests are critical. A single Javascript<br />
context overhead per process.</p>
<p>Scaling to multiple cores involves multiple processes, handing off the socket<br />
file descriptor and accepting the connection on the child process, letting the<br />
kernel do the round robin. Note that there are other ways to scale out, but<br />
this is the preferred way.</p>
<p>On spawn vs fork, i.e. describe Bene's patch.</p>
<h2>Do we need threads? Handing off CPU-bound workloads</h2>
<p>WebWorkers to child process, not effective, need for multi-threading to fully<br />
effectively leverage multi-core configurations, e.g. 64 cores. Discussion on<br />
process vs thread based, and why we want threads.</p>
<h2>Adding Javascript</h2>
<ul>
<li>Single threaded I/O: must ensure reliability, if the reactor comes down,<br />
it's a BIG deal as thousands of accepted socket connections will reset. MTTF<br />
must be very high. It comes down to V8 handling errors more gracefully and<br />
allowing recovery.</li>
<li>CPU bound workload: running a separate Javascript context per thread. There<br />
are two options, the V8-way or the-other-Javascript-engine way.</p>
<ul>
<li>V8 uses statics and, unlike other Javascript engines, none of the method<br />
signatures passes the context along. We could move all statics in V8 into<br />
a context object and pass it along in thread local storage when we call<br />
::Lock.</li>
<li>Switch from V8 to a context-per-thread engine, e.g. JaegerMonkey or<br />
JavaScriptCore. To allow compatibility with V8, we would need to hide the<br />
Context object being passed along on every call to the engine. We would<br />
create a V8-like API that does that magic behind the scenes using thread<br />
local storage.</li>
<li>In either case, we'd have to do some similar fixes in NodeJS itself, as<br />
most of the statics would need to move onto a separate global object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decoupling Reactor and JS</h2>
<ul>
<li>If JS drives the reactor, a JS-engine failure, kills the reactor.</li>
</ul>
