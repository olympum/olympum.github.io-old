<p><strong>Update (2011/9/11)</strong>: this post is picking up again 8 months later, I've <a href="http://www.olympum.com/architecture/ahead-with-node-js-and-google-v8/">written an update</a> as of where we stand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jason Hoffman (Chief Scientist, Founder at Joyent) has posted some <a href="http://joyeur.com/2011/02/05/on-brunos-concern-about-the-current-coupling-of-node-js-and-v8/">good<br />
questions to<br />
me</a>,<br />
based on my original <a href="http://www.olympum.com/future/nodejs-to-v8-or-not-to-v8/">nodejs and<br />
V8</a> post. Let me<br />
summarise Jason's questions and comments into three key messages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It's Joyent's responsibility that NodeJS runs well period. We're not<br />
  afraid of a language VM. [...] actual node.js committers (who all work<br />
  at Joyent) know quite a bit and have pretty good relations with the V8<br />
  team.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a very honourable goal and perfectly within Joyent's capabilities and track record. I am <em>not</em> debating that.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If there are actual technical problems with V8′s reliability or ???<br />
  and these affect the use of node.js in production then I’d like to<br />
  see details.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion is not really whether I have technical production problems or<br />
not with V8 (within NodeJS); all software has bugs. My issue is about project<br />
governance. Let's say such a problem affecting reliability exists and that<br />
Joyent fixes it by developing a critical patch for V8, a patch that the<br />
upstream maintainer does not deem it necessary to merge. For how long would<br />
Joyent maintain and test such patches?</p>
<p>Another aspect of governance: intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>My point: it's not whether Google's V8 project is open or not, it's that since<br />
governance of V8 may become a problem <em>in the future</em>, it requires a solution<br />
<em>now</em> so that large organisations can put their full weight behind NodeJS.<br />
Joyent's weight behind NodeJS is necessary, but not sufficient. I prefer<br />
addressing the problems in the code.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  node.js is only implemented on V8 but that’s only because we’re<br />
  going to focus on making node.js awesome first. [...] After all, we<br />
  are still working on getting it to 1.0
</p></blockquote>
<p>Open source software is commonly designed to make it easy to replace parts or<br />
components that may be at risk of being legally tainted or patent encumbered<br />
(e.g. mono's architecture as an example of isolation). I would put V8 in the<br />
same bucket of "risky parts", although for different reasons. Given the lack<br />
of definition on Google's V8 project governance, and the current tight<br />
coupling between node and V8, I wonder how realistic it will be to implement a<br />
different VM post-1.0 if we haven't got the right layer of abstraction<br />
pre-1.0. Or perhaps the problem (the reassurance of governance) can be<br />
addressed by working under the umbrella of a foundation that ensures such<br />
governance.</p>
<p>Let me end by saying that I am still as committed as ever to NodeJS and that I<br />
really believe in Joyent's engineering strength to make NodeJS 1.0 a reality.<br />
Joyent is putting their money where their mouth is. We know they are working<br />
hard making node <em>awesome</em>.</p>
