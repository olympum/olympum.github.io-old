<p>I've been using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> since<br />
2006, taking all my notes at work using a simple text editor and using the<br />
Markdown text markup format. I also use Markdown for writing down thoughts and<br />
posting to this blog. I rarely, if ever, use Word or even TeX/LaTeX. I treat<br />
markdown as my source format and I generate all my target formats using<br />
<a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">multimarkdown</a>: PDF, HTML, RTF,<br />
etc.</p>
<p>I am happy with this process. I use a standard editor I find in any operating<br />
system I happen to work with. I use a standard document format I know I will<br />
be able to open in years to come: plain text. I use source control to version<br />
my text files and synchronize between computers. This works everywhere I have<br />
git and I am not locked-in into any particular cloud or tool or format or ...</p>
<p>As an editor, I use <a href="http://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/">emacs markdown<br />
mode</a> and it does me well. And<br />
it's not about <a href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/">emacs</a>: you may use<br />
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>, or <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, or whatever.<br />
The point is that your favorite text editor, whichever it is, is probably good<br />
enough. I have also recently started using <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a> as<br />
a convenience for previewing the transformed markdown output without having to<br />
continuously switch back to the browser or do <code>C-c C-c p</code> all the time.</p>
<p>I also use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to transform some of my markdown<br />
text files onto a static site where <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> is the glue<br />
here. It works everywhere I have git.</p>
<p>Recently I have had a need to bring my markdown files to the iPhone and the<br />
iPad. And although one may find some specialized git iOS clients for things<br />
like <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, there is no general git client for iOS,<br />
integrated with a text viewer, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Given the lack of shared file system in iOS, whichever app I use must have<br />
both text editor, ideally with support for markdown preview, as well as sync<br />
capabilities. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id396073482?mt=8">Nocs</a> is<br />
exactly that. It uses <a href="http://db.tt/4rTs9QST">Dropbox</a> to sync your files, and<br />
it has an embedded text editor with markdowns support. It fits perfectly into<br />
my workflow. I continue to use emacs on the laptop, and Nocs on the iPad.<br />
Dropbox syncs between laptop and tablet, and git between computers.</p>
<p>I am sure there are ways I could simplify the flow. But for now, this meets my<br />
requirements.</p>
<p>Finally, I am not keen at all to use tools like<br />
<a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, since as far as I am concerned I am<br />
losing both freedom and the future-proof aspects of plain text. I have<br />
literally thousands of text notes accumulated over the years, and I have the<br />
reassurance that I will always be able to access and edit my notes in years to<br />
come. I don't want to risk putting my documents onto a proprietary platform.</p>
