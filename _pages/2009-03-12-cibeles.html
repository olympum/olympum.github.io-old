<p>Cibeles was a simple workflow manager based on Petri network model semantics. I later on rewrote the code using bytecode emit and the ASM library for a client, and Cibeles sort of died since then. The original interpreted code is still available on the <a href="http://developer.novell.com/wiki/index.php/Special:Downloads/simetron/cibeles/0.01/">Novell project page</a>.</p>
