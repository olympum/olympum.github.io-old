<p>The first startup I funded a few years back was Yamigo, a mobile instant messaging solution based on the Wireless Village initiative, later integrated into the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) and renamed as Instant Messaging and Presence Services (IMPS). Interestingly, native chat clients using OMA IMPS are found in almost 500 million handsets, yet it is little used. Yamigo did remarkably well despite operators not being friendly, building up to 150,000 users.  I am not involved any longer with this service.</p>
<p>My second attempt to get mobile instant messaging was Onesoup. Onesoup was pretty much like Yamigo, but with a simpler user experience, and no registration required, all transparent. I am not any longer associated with Onesoup.</p>
