I am a caf√© dude, technology entrepreneur and wanna-be investor. I am driven by the technical prowess that creates new business opportunities. I currently work at Yahoo as a sr fellow, focusing in targeting personalized ads & content, especially for mobile.

I enjoy coding and I don't think it's possible to remain a technologist without coding. I started off with a Sinclair ZX81 my dad bought me for Christmas in 1982, right after its release. The Spectrum has a built-in BASIC interpreter and is able to generate a 16-colour palette and some degree of sound modulation. All in a grand 1024 bytes. The Spectrum was quite a novelty, but honestly quite boring otherwise. It would power up, show a black screen, then a copyright on a white background, and finally you would get a `$` prompt where to type `load` and start the tape. Loading a program would take anything between 3 and 5 minutes, and most frequently the load would fail right at the end of the tape - back to the white screen. Applications on the Spectrum were really not good at all. I got tired of playing the load-the-tape-to-reboot game and like many children of my age I decided to explore the assembler for the ZX80/ZX81 (copying verbatum endless pages of hex code from magazines!). Ah, fun! The ZX81 assembler had suddenly opened what I thought at the time were infinite opportunities. From the early Sinclair days, I was hooked into software development and programming languages, moving through BASIC, C, 8088 assembler, Lisp, Pascal, Fortran, C++, Smalltalk, Java, Ruby, Scala, Clojure, JavaScript and recently Go.

I am most grateful to my parents for opening the doors to what started as a hobby but ended up becoming my professional career.
